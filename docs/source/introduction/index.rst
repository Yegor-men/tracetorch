Introduction
============

``traceTorch`` has a decent bit of background theory. It's not difficult, but it is heavily recommended to be sufficiently
familiar with the terminology and concepts that are going to be used throughout. :doc:`L0 <../introduction/L0_snn>`
focuses exactly on that.

It's also heavily recommended to familiarize yourself with the ``tracetorch.snn`` layers and their API, at least for the
simplest layers (``LIF``, ``Readout``, ``SLIF``, ``RLIF``). If you're interested in fully understanding how
``traceTorch`` layers work and how you can make your own layers, then it's especially recommended to do all the lessons
in order, especially :doc:`L6 <../introduction/L6_leaky_integrator>`, in order to understand how the ``LeakyIntegrator``
works and how to use it.
