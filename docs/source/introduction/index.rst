Introduction
============

Before proceeding with the library and tutorials, it is recommended to familiarize yourself with some background theory
behind SNNs, and the reasoning behind traceTorch. This isn't strictly necessary, but understanding why certain things are
done a certain way, as well as everything behind traceTorch should help you make and debug models.
