Introduction
============

``traceTorch`` has a decent bit of background theory. It's not difficult, but it is heavily recommended to be sufficiently
familiar with the terminology and concepts that are going to be used throughout. :doc:`L0 <../introduction/L0_snn>`
focuses exactly on that.

It's also recommended to familiarize yourself with the ``tracetorch.snn`` layers and their features, API, and how they
integrate with the rest of ``PyTorch``. :doc:`L1 <../introduction/L1_ttmodule>` and :doc:`L2 <../introduction/L2_tracetorch_layers>`
focus exactly on that.

``traceTorch`` also provides the ``LeakyIntegrator`` superclass, with a lot more experimental features available, allowing
you to create your own funky layers. :doc:`L3 <../introduction/L3_leaky_integrator>` focuses exactly on that.

It's recommended to do the lessons in order. Detailed explanations of the modules themselves can be found :doc:`here <../reference/index>`.
