A strict, ergonomic, and powerful Spiking Neural Network (SNN) library for PyTorch.

This documentation is written to help you familiarize with SNNs and traceTorch. By the end of it, you should have all
the background knowledge necessary to understand and make your own networks, as well as a solid understanding of the library
and good practices for creating powerful models. It is recommended to at least briefly read the :doc:`introduction <../introduction/index>`
section to familiarize yourself with some background theory and terminology before proceeding with the library.
